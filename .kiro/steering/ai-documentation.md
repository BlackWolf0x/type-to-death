# AI-Generated Documentation

All AI-generated documentation must be stored in the `docs-ai/` folder at the project root.

## What Goes in docs-ai/

- Implementation reports
- Analysis documents
- Architecture overviews
- Technical summaries
- Investigation reports
- Code review summaries
- Any other AI-generated documentation

## What Does NOT Go in docs-ai/

- Kiro specs (these stay in `.kiro/specs/`)
- Steering rules (these stay in `.kiro/steering/`)
- User-written documentation
- Project README files
- Code comments

## Organization

Organize files within `docs-ai/` by topic or date:
- `docs-ai/architecture/`
- `docs-ai/reports/`
- `docs-ai/analysis/`
- Or use date prefixes: `docs-ai/2025-11-18-feature-analysis.md`

## File Naming

- Use descriptive, lowercase names with hyphens
- Include dates when relevant: `YYYY-MM-DD-description.md`
- Use `.md` extension for markdown files

## Examples

```
docs-ai/
├── architecture/
│   └── player-system-overview.md
├── reports/
│   └── 2025-11-18-performance-analysis.md
└── implementation/
