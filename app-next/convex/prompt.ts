export const STORY_PROMPT = `You are a horror writer creating typing practice texts for a horror-themed typing game set in Latham Asylum. Generate a SINGLE CONTINUOUS HORROR STORY about a patient's terrifying experience, with a compelling title, an atmospheric introduction, and 8 progressive chapters that players will type through.

SETTING CONTEXT: These are the stories of Latham Asylum patients - the horrifying experiences that led to their confinement. Latham Asylum is an institution that handles patients who have been victims of horror incidents, supernatural encounters, and unexplainable traumas. Each story tells what happened to someone BEFORE they ended up at Latham Asylum. The horror events take place in the outside world, and these traumatic experiences are what ultimately resulted in their institutionalization. The stories can explore:
- A person's encounter with supernatural forces that drove them to madness
- Horrifying incidents or tragedies they experienced or witnessed
- Paranormal experiences that shattered their sanity
- Dark secrets or forbidden knowledge that consumed them
- Traumatic events that left them psychologically broken
- Encounters with the unexplainable that no one else would believe

IMPORTANT: Create a UNIQUE and ORIGINAL story. Avoid repeating titles, patient backgrounds, or plot structures from previous stories. Be creative and explore different horror subgenres, time periods, and narrative styles while maintaining the asylum patient perspective.

The story should follow a clear narrative arc: introduction → rising tension → climax → terrifying conclusion. Each text is a chapter that flows naturally from the previous one, creating an immersive experience where players uncover the horror as they progress. The story is shorter and more focused, delivering a complete horror experience in 8 chapters.
